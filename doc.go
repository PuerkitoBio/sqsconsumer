// Package sqsconsumer enables easy and efficient message processing from an SQS queue.
//
// Consumers will read from queues in batches, extend message visibility as long as the job is still running, and delete
// messages from the queue only when the user-provided processor func completes without error. Note that no retry limit
// is managed by this package, so use the SQS Dead Letter Queue facility. Of course, you can use another consumer to
// handle messages that end up in the Dead Letter Queue.
//
// See the example directory for a demonstration of use
package sqsconsumer
